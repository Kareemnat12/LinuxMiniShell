**what will hppen if the argv file is empty????
**should we start the time measure immeditly after getting the user input ? and what about the wrong commands that is not able to compile or danger command ?
** should we append in the log file the wrong or dangours commands or even if we write stuff is not command or commands that has errors like with more that 6 args ??
** for every new run for the program we should create a new log file or append to the old one ?
** dose wrong commands we need to calculate its time ?



*** dont forget to change argv name from the main and file read function 
***and also dont forget to check if the time is efficient
*** i think we should take in account the argument check in the main
