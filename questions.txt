Dont forget to correct the statistics stuff mesurements and include them for waits stuff


dose the | must be with one space or it can be without space?


dont forget to use signal handler for wait pid and these sstuff

dose max args for total with pipe or for every command has its own max args?

dont forget to check the output file to return full command

what will happen for & and time mesuerment?
handle the shit of &  aolone important

dose the 2> file append in the run ? or it ovverite in every error ?


dose we use my_tee only after pipe? or it might be used in left command


for instance if we put wrong command the error will be shown twice


 ithink every command and its args thus the command line limit of args only works when i have command

can done be after pipe ?


    char *args[] = {"rlimit", "set", "cpu=2:4", "mem=20", "nofile=3:4","echo ", "hello","2>", NULL};

HARD LIMIT AND SOFT LIMIT DEBUG TODO
