
Handling Empty Input and Leading Spaces:
What should we do if the input is empty, or if the first or last character is a space?

Handling Input Longer than 1024 Characters:
Should we take action if the input exceeds 1024 characters? For instance, should we print an error message or handle the situation differently?

Handling New Lines in Input:
Can the input contain new lines (e.g., echo hi or multi-line input like im kareem)? How should we handle it?

Counting NULL Elements in Command Arguments:
When an argument array contains a NULL element (e.g., {"ls", "-l", NULL}), should it be counted as part of the length of the array? Is the length 2 or 3 in this case?

Error Handling Behavior:
When an error occurs (such as invalid input or command failure), should we terminate the program immediately, or should we allow the user to continue and try again with a new command?

Dangerous Commands:
Are dangerous commands limited to a predefined list, or could there be more commands we need to handle dynamically? How should we manage them?


what will hppen if the argv file is empty????

should we start the time measure immeditly after getting the user input ? and what about the wrong commands that is not able to compile or danger command ?

*** dont forget to handle space when u deal with strcmp for instace with "done" when u want to finish the commands 



*** dont forget to change argv name from the main and file read function 
and also dont forget to check if the time is efficient


** dose wrong commands we need to calculate its time ?
** i think we should take in account the argument check in the main
